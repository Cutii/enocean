The core of a random number generator.\n \n This trait encapsulates the low-level functionality common to all\n generators, and is the \"back end\", to be implemented by generators.\n End users should normally use [`Rng`] from the [rand] crate, which is\n automatically implemented for every type implementing `RngCore`.\n \n Three different methods for generating random data are provided since the\n optimal implementation of each is dependent on the type of generator. There\n is no required relationship between the output of each; e.g. many\n implementations of [`fill_bytes`] consume a whole number of `u32` or `u64`\n values and drop any remaining unused bytes.\n \n The [`try_fill_bytes`] method is a variant of [`fill_bytes`] allowing error\n handling; it is not deemed sufficiently useful to add equivalents for\n [`next_u32`] or [`next_u64`] since the latter methods are almost always used\n with algorithmic generators (PRNGs), which are normally infallible.\n \n Algorithmic generators implementing [`SeedableRng`] should normally have\n *portable, reproducible* output, i.e. fix Endianness when converting values\n to avoid platform differences, and avoid making any changes which affect\n output (except by communicating that the release has breaking changes).\n \n Typically implementators will implement only one of the methods available\n in this trait directly, then use the helper functions from the\n [`rand_core::impls`] module to implement the other methods.\n \n It is recommended that implementations also implement:\n \n - `Debug` with a custom implementation which *does not* print any internal\n   state (at least, [`CryptoRng`]s should not risk leaking state through\n   `Debug`).\n - `Serialize` and `Deserialize` (from Serde), preferably making Serde\n   support optional at the crate level in PRNG libs.\n - `Clone`, if possible.\n - *never* implement `Copy` (accidental copies may cause repeated values).\n - *do not* implement `Default` for pseudorandom generators, but instead\n   implement [`SeedableRng`], to guide users towards proper seeding.\n   External / hardware RNGs can choose to implement `Default`.\n - `Eq` and `PartialEq` could be implemented, but are probably not useful.\n \n # Example\n \n A simple example, obviously not generating very *random* output:\n \n ```\n #![allow(dead_code)]\n use rand_core::{RngCore, Error, impls};\n \n struct CountingRng(u64);\n \n impl RngCore for CountingRng {\n     fn next_u32(&mut self) -> u32 {\n         self.next_u64() as u32\n     }\n     \n     fn next_u64(&mut self) -> u64 {\n         self.0 += 1;\n         self.0\n     }\n
